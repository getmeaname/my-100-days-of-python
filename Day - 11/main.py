## The deck is unlimited in size. 
## There are no jokers. 
## The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
## The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.
## Use the following list as the deck of cards:
## cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
## The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
## Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
## The computer is the dealer.

##################### Hints #####################

#Hint 1: Go to this website and try out the Blackjack game: 
#   https://games.washingtonpost.com/games/blackjack/
#Then try out the completed Blackjack project here: 
#   http://blackjack-final.appbrewery.repl.run
import random
from replit import clear
from art import logo
#Hint 2: Read this breakdown of program requirements: 
#   http://listmoz.com/view/6h34DJpvJBFVRlZfJvxF
#Then try to create your own flowchart for the program.

#Hint 6: Create a function called calculate_score() that takes a List of cards as input 
#and returns the score. 
#Look up the sum() function to help you do this.

# calculate_score(user_total=sum(user_cards), computer_total=sum(computer_cards))
def calculate_score(cards):
#Hint 7: Inside calculate_score() check for a blackjack (a hand with only 2 cards: ace + 10) and return 0 instead of the actual score. 0 will represent a blackjack in our game.
  if sum(cards) == 21 and len(cards) == 2:
    return 0
#Hint 8: Inside calculate_score() check for an 11 (ace). If the score is already over 21, remove the 11 and replace it with a 1. You might need to look up append() and remove().
  if cards == 11 and sum(cards) > 21:
    cards.remove(11) and cards.append(1)
  # if 11 in cards and sum(cards) > 21:
  #   cards.remove(11)
  #   cards.append(1)
  return sum(cards)
#Hint 3: Download and read this flow chart I've created: 
#   https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1rDkiHCrhaf9eX7u7yjM1qwSuyEk-rPnt

#Hint 4: Create a deal_card() function that uses the List below to *return* a random card.
#11 is the Ace.

def deal_card():
  cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
  random_card = random.choice(cards)
  return random_card

def compare(score1, score2):
    if score1 == score2:
      return "draw"
    elif score2 == 0:
      return "user loses"
    elif score1 == 0:
      return "user wins"
    elif score1 > 21:
      return "user loses"
    elif score2 > 21:
      return "user wins"
    elif score1 > score2:
      return "You win"
    else:
      return "You lose"
#Hint 5: Deal the user and computer 2 cards each using deal_card() and append().
def play_game():
  print(logo)
  user_cards = [deal_card(), deal_card()]
  computer_cards = [deal_card(), deal_card()]
  is_game_over = False
  
  # for i in range(2):
  #   # new_card = deal_card()
  #   user_cards.append(deal_card())
  #   computer_cards.append(deal_card())
  
  #Hint 13: Create a function called compare() and pass in the user_score and computer_score. If the computer and user both have the same score, then it's a draw. If the computer has a blackjack (0), then the user loses. If the user has a blackjack (0), then the user wins. If the user_score is over 21, then the user loses. If the computer_score is over 21, then the computer loses. If none of the above, then the player with the highest score wins.
  
  #Hint 9: Call calculate_score(). If the computer or the user has a blackjack (0) or if the user's score is over 21, then the game ends.
  
  while is_game_over == False:
    user_score = calculate_score(user_cards)
    computer_score = calculate_score(computer_cards)
    
    print(f"Your cards{user_cards}, Your score : {user_score}")
    print(f"Dealer card {computer_cards[0]}")
    
    #Hint 10: If the game has not ended, ask the user if they want to draw another card. If yes, then use the deal_card() function to add another card to the user_cards List. If no, then the game has ended.
    if user_score == 0 or computer_score == 0 or user_score > 21:
      is_game_over = True
    else:
      draw_card = input("Do you want to draw another card y or n: ")
      if draw_card == 'y':
        user_cards.append(deal_card())
      else:
        is_game_over = True
    
  #Hint 11: The score will need to be rechecked with every new card drawn and the checks in Hint 9 need to be repeated until the game ends.
  
  #Hint 12: Once the user is done, it's time to let the computer play. The computer should keep drawing cards as long as it has a score less than 17.
  while computer_score != 0 and computer_score < 17:
    computer_cards.append(deal_card())
    computer_score = calculate_score(computer_cards)
  
  print(f" your hand : {user_cards}, your score : {user_score}")
  print(f" dealer hand : {computer_cards}, dealer score : {computer_score}")
  print(compare(score1=user_score, score2= computer_score))

#Hint 14: Ask the user if they want to restart the game. If they answer yes, clear the console and start a new game of blackjack and show the logo from art.py.
while input("Do you want to play blackjack y or n ") == 'y':
  clear()
  play_game()
